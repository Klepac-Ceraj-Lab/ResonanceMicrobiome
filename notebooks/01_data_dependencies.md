# Notebook 01 - Data Dependencies

Data require for these analyses can be downloaded from [OSF.io](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YBS32).

**TODO**: add in links once data is uploaded

1. Read count data after `kneaddata` quality control ([link](#)) is used in Notebook 02.
1. Taxonomic profiles  ([link](#)) generated by `metaphlan` are used in Notebook 03.
1. Functional profiles generated by `humann` are used in Notebook 04.
   There are several functional tables that contain similar information,
   but in different forms. All are relative abundance normalized.
   1. `genefamilies_relab` ([link](#)):
      These files contain [UniRef90 ids](https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref).
      These are the most complete, but the files are enormous.
   1. `pfam_names_relab` ([link](#)):
      These files contain [protein family ids](http://pfam.xfam.org)
      and their human-readable names.
   1. `ko_names_relab` ([link](#)):
      These files contain [KEGG Orthology ids](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ko.html)
      and their human-readable names.
   1. `ec_names_relab` ([link](#)):
      These files contain [4-level enzyme commission numbers](https://enzyme.expasy.org)
      and their human-readable names.
1. Raw metagenomic sequences are not analyzed here directly,
   but can be acquired from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) ([link](#))

## Data Downloads

Data can be automatically downloaded using DataDeps.jl.
The first time you try to use a dataset,
you will be asked if you want to download it.
Simply respond "yes", and the data will be downloaded and unpacked.
By default, data will be sent to `~/.julia/datadeps`,
but this can be changed by setting the environmental variable `DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH`.


```julia
julia> using ResonanceMicrobiome

julia> ENV["DATADEPS_LOAD_PATH"] = "/home/kevin/Desktop"
"/home/kevin/Desktop"

julia> datadep"taxonomic_profiles"
This program has requested access to the data dependency taxonomic_profiles.
which is not currently installed. It can be installed automatically, and you will not see this message again.

Taxonomic profiles generated by MetaPhlAn.



Do you want to download the dataset from https://osf.io/kyh48/download to "/home/kevin/Desktop/taxonomic_profiles"?
[y/n]
```
